TechPlot
========

I often have to create technical 3D vector drawings to explain definitions and variables. There are a lot of programs that allow me to do this easily in 2D with good enough quality, but for 3D I have not found any and been forced to use 2D tools and by hand guess how the 3D projections would look.

TechPlot will help me solve this problem.

Planned features
=================
  * svg export
  * latex inlining
  * tree view of object and rotation/translation chains
  * angle definitions
